# Health and sleep statistics Analysis
## Health and Sleep Statistics

## Objective
The objective of the Health and Sleep Statistics project is to analyze fictional data regarding individuals' sleep habits and physical activities. This analysis aims to uncover insights related to sleep quality and its correlations with various factors such as physical activity levels, dietary habits, and sleep disorders.

## Goal
The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help individuals improve their health and sleep quality based on the analysis of the dataset. The project will utilize data visualization and predictive modeling techniques to present findings clearly and effectively.

## Steps
1. **Data Exploration**: Understand the structure of the dataset and identify any data quality issues.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values, outliers, and ensure data types are correct.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize relationships between variables to derive insights.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict sleep quality and disorders.
5. **Results Presentation**: Generate visualizations and compile a final report summarizing key findings.

## Programming Languages:
**Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

**Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

**Data Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn

**Version Control**: Git/GitHub
